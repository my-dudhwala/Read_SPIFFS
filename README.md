# Read_SPIFFS
This is modified code or the original SPPIFS code provided in Arduino examples. This code shows files if there are any in the SPIFFS, creates a file, writes its data, defined in function calling instruction in Setup loop, then reads it. It can work for both Arduino and ESP32 and tested on ESP32.
