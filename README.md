# Read_SPIFFS
This is modified code of the original SPPIFS code provided in Arduino examples. This code shows files if there are any in the SPIFFS, creates a file, writes its data, file and and data need to be write are defined in the "function calling instruction" in Setup loop, then reads it. It can work for both Arduino and ESP32 and tested on ESP32.
